        1   How  do the  declarations  look in  the  GIMPLE? Specifically,  what
            happens to multiple  variables declared and initialized  on the same
            line? What happens to global declaration [int Z]?

        2   How are complex  expressions such as [c  = a * b +  25] broken down?
            Can you  determine a  rule as  to when  temporary variables  will be
            introduced?

        3   How are  floats/doubles represented in  GIMPLE? What happens  when a
            float/double is assigned to an integer in [Z = r]?

        4   How  are reads/writes  to the  global variable  Z performed?  Why is
            there a temporary introduced  for the statement [Z = Z  + 1] but not
            for the statements [q = Z] or [Z = p]?

	1    GIMPLE declartions are similar to that in C with the exception that 
	     multiple declartions in one line for multiple variables of the same 
	     type cannot be made; Each varible must be declared individually.
	     However, global variables are not declared by directly used. Also
	     GIMPLE only allows one operation at a time.

	2    GIMPLE breaks down complex expressions, calculates and stores each 
	     operation as a temporary variable except for the final and simple
	     expression. Creating temporay variables for simple expressions just
	     causes bloating, 

	3    GIMPLE represents floats and doubles in the form of "scientific 
	     numbers".

	4    Since GIMPLE only allows one operation at a time we can directly 
	     read and write but to perform further operations we must create a 
	     temporary variable. This temporary variable first registers the
	     global variable in the memory from the main memory, so that now
	     procedures can be done on it in the defined scope. Global  
	     temporaries are named similar to the global variable but with a 
	     numeric suffix.
