Questions 
----------

	1   How have if-blocks  been translated into GIMPLE  statements? Can you
            differentiate between conditional and unconditional gotos?

        2   Repeat  the  above compilation,  but  now  asking for  another  dump
            that  of  the pass  "cfg".  View  this  pass  and say  whether  this
            representation makes it easier to  read and understand GIMPLEs. Draw
            the control-flow graph  of the program A-2.c on a  piece of paper by
            looking at the CFG dump.

	1   The entire control flow has been broken into blocks in the GIMPLE
	    Statements. Unconditional gotos eg. goto <D.1977>; will have no
	    conditions mentioned before or after unlike conditional gotos eg.
	    if (a<=9) goto <D.1975>; else goto <D.1976>;

	2   The CFG dump shows blocks of labeled code. Its makes it easier to
	    read the GIMPLE
	  
	    f ()
                {
                  int c;
                  int b;
                  int a;
                  int Z.0;
                  int D.1715;

                <bb 2>:
                  a = Z;
                  if (a <= 9)
                    goto <bb 3>;
                  else
                    goto <bb 4>;

                <bb 3>:
                  b = 5;
                  c = 17;
                  goto <bb 6>;

                <bb 4>:
                  b = 6;
                  c = 20;
                  if (a == 0)
                    goto <bb 5>;
                  else
                    goto <bb 6>;

                <bb 5>:
                  c = 0;

                <bb 6>:
                  D.1715 = b * 10;
                  Z.0 = D.1715 + c;
                  Z = Z.0;
                  return;

                }

		
		The control flow graph is somewhat like this:
	
			2 -> 3 -> 4
	        	3 -> 6
			4 -> 5 -> 6

Additional Problem
------------------

        Try to figure  out how GCC handles the  ternary operator [a ? b  : c] in
        GIMPLE.

	
	GIMPLE handles ternary operators just like if else blocks.
