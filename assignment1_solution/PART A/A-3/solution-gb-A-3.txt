        1   Identify the basic blocks that correspond  to the while loop. How is
            the GIMPLE for a while loop different from simple if-else jumps?

        2   Identify the  basic blocks  for the nested  for-loop. You  should be
            able  to identify  intializers, conditions  and increments  for each
            loop as  well as  the shared  inner body.  Is there  really anything
            special about a for-loop as compared to a while-loop?

	1    In this program blocks 4,3,2 correspond to the while loop. While
	     -loop blocks have been written similar to if-else blocks but the
	     order is backwards.
	
	2    In this program blocks 8,7,6 correspond to the nested for-loop. In
	     GIMPLE there isnt any difference between the way of writing either
	     of the loops.
