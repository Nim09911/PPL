---------

        1   How is array declaration and initialization handled?

        2   Why does the statement a[i] = b[i] get broken down to two steps with
            an intermediate temporary?

        3   Why are there CLOBBER statements at the end?

--------

	1   First arrays are declared, then for each element in the array,individual
	    initialization takes place (as GIMPLE does 1 step at a time.)

	
	2   GIMPLE can perform 1 step at a time so first it can only read or write
	    from the array memory (as to access arrays in constant time requires
	    calculation) so it is stored as a temporary variable before performing
            any other calculation. 

	3    CLOBBER statments signify that the scope if this variable has ended
