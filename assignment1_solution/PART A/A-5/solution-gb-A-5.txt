        1   Do you notice that each usage of local variable as an operand uses a
            suffix that can be tracked to it's assignment? Why do some variables
            have a suffix `(D)'?

        2   Find the point in the CFG in  which the paths of the two assignments
            to variable `a'  and `b' merge. You will notice  that PHI statements
            have  been  introduced.  Can  you   guess  the  syntax  of  the  PHI
            statements?

        3   Can you think of an example in which a PHI node merges more than two
            versions of a variable?

	1   Local variables are assigned with a suffix of a unique number to 
	    signify that they have been assigned. If the varible has a suffix
	    as a number followed by '(D)' then it signifys that the varaible has
	    been without being assigned.

	2   PHI statements have been introduced in block 5. Syntax:
	    var_1 = PHI<var_2(No. times assigned),var_3(No. times assigned)....>

	3   Yes, PHI nodes can merge more than two nodes of the same variabe.
	    eg. Multiple conditional statements involving the same variable.
	    
	    if(marks > 40){
		grade = 7
	    }
	    else if (marks > 60){
		grade = 8
	    }
	    else if (marks > 75){
		grade = 9
	    }
	    else(marks > 90){
		grade = 10
	    }

	    grade_1 = PHI<grade_2(2), grade_3(3), grade_4(4), grade_5(5)>
